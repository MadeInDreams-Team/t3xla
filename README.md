## Getting started with T3XLA 

The T3XLA Network is a Proof-of Concept project to demonstrate the possibility of having a Blockchain and a cryptocurrency that can run on smaller device like Raspberry Pi. This reduces the carbon footprint generated on the hardware production level. Not only a Raspberry Pi require less material to produce but it requires only3 to 5 volts to run. This is making it the perfect candidate for renewable energy. A raspberry Pi could run on a 6V battery that can be charge using renewable energy like solar panels or wind mils. This make the t3XLA project the perfect concept for a sustainable blockchain with low carbon footprint.

## What's changed

The wallet is the node and perform validation/mining while it is on. Everyone can participate and it is totally free.
When your wallet is open you are participating on the network and earning. Since you are participating, the transactions are free. That is right, anyone can participate in the validation process making it decentralized and accessible. At this time, the T3XLA Green Blockchain Project is bearing a coin, the next phase will bring BOT (Blockchain Of Things), connecting the real world to the blockchain. Smart Contract that activates real world machines. 

## Our Carbon Footprint.

The carbon footprint of the entire ecosystem at full scale is negligible compare to a space flight.

## Use Case

The BOT phase, (Blockchain Of Things) Smart contract that activate real worlds machines...

Coining soonâ€¦
